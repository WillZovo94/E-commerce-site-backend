## Description
- This project includes a backend JavaScript E-Commerce site. You're given a database and server with routing. You're able to access different categories, products, and tags within the url requests. 
- My motivation for working and creating this project was to further understand databases and understanding get, posts, delete, and put requests. As well as express, sequelize, and routing.

## Usage 
- Use NPM Install to install the dependencies.
- Input node seeds/index.js into the console to seed the database.
- Then run node server.js to run the server.
- You're given access to a database with products, categories, and tags.
- You're able to update, create, search, and delete all products, categories, and tags.
